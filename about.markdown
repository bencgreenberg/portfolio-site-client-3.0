# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
<img src="/assets/images/ben.jpg" style="border-radius: 50%; padding-right:5px" height="90px" width="240px" align="left" alt="A picture of Ben.">

Thanks for stopping by! If you're looking at this page you are probably trying to figure out who this person is. If that's the case, let me tell you a bit about me. ðŸ¤—

## Who is Ben? 

Professionally, I consider myself an educator above all else. What does that mean for me? It means that whatever I am doing, whether it is building a new voice app in TypeScript, creating a video application in Ruby on Rails or refactoring an SDK, I do it with an eye towards what I can share with others.

I love teaching and learning with folks. Sometimes that means I share ideas on the stage at conferences. Other times, it means I am streaming on Twitch or running a local meetup. However it happens, I am most happy when I get to work at the intersection of tech and community!

## What is Ben doing for work nowadays?

I have had the great joy of working as a Developer Advocate for more than 2 years at <a href="https://developer.nexmo.com" style="color:blue">Vonage</a>. There I have the opportunity to build our SDKs, create demo applications, share interesting ideas with a global audience and a lot more. I love what I do and proud of the work we as a team accomplish.

## What does Ben do outside of work?

Well, I'm glad you asked! If I am not working, I am usually spending time with my family. I have two boys and a partner who I am incredibly blessed to call my family.

We live in a beautiful city just a few minutes from the tech center of Tel Aviv. During the weekends we like to explore our neighborhood parks, spend time with friends, and on longer holidays, explore the rest of the country.

## How can I get in touch?

I am always happy to chat! If you'd like to reach out you can find me on the various social channels:
