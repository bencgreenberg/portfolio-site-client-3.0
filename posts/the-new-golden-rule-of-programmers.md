242 years ago the American Declaration of Independence was signed, and with it, a new paradigm for governance came into being. This government has experienced many highs and many lows, it continues to evolve and adapt. Yet, throughout it all, the underlying notion that people have a right to exert autonomy over their lives and can construct lives that are meaningful for them, in all of our myriad ways we interpret meaning, remains a fundamental foundation.

242 years after American independence, it is now time for programmers of the world to declare our independence and institute a new golden rule for our industry. Just as the colonists sought freedom from an oppressive ruling authority across the ocean, programmers of the world seek freedom from unnecessary interruptions that reduce our productivity, destroy our thought process and, in general, disrupt the work flow.

Yes, I am talking about the most insidious of issues plaguing our community: 

**The Headphone Interruption&trade;**

We all know it. We all have experienced it. You are in the zone. Your headphones are pumping the sounds into your ears that motivate and keep you focused, whether that's an NPR podcast, metal, jazz, country, or whatever gets your coding groove on. Then you feel it. The eyes of someone wanting to get your attention are burning a hole in the back of your head. The sounds of someone saying, "excuse me?," "excuse me?" starts to filter into your consciousness. Then it escalates and the tap on the shoulder is next. If none of those elicit a reaction, your headphones are lifted off your head.

You turn to face the person who so desparately sought your attention. It must be truly important. 

* "Just wanted you to see those rain clouds outside. It looks like it's going to pour today!" 
* "Can I pick you up something from the break room? I'm going to go get a coffee."
* "Any plans for the weekend?"
* "Is that English on your screen? It looks like it's from the Matrix!"
* "Did you know {random co-worker} is going on vacation soon? How lucky!"

These are all real world examples from the field of The Headphone Interruption&trade;.

So, friends, on this day of barbecues, flag waving and reveling in the American experience (with apologies to my friends from other countries) let us declare and proclaim a new golden rule for programmers around the globe.

**If the headphones are on and it's not an emergency, it can wait.**

To all of our non-programming colleagues, we affirm that we like you, we like talking with you, we enjoy our coffee breaks and spending quality time together. The headphones are not a sign of our dislike of you at all. Rather, they are a necessary instrument to allow us to focus in the open floor plan offices of our modern era. 

If we will it, it can be more than a dream. We can make this a reality. 

Headphones on? It can wait.
